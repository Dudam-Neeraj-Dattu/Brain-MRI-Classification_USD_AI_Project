# This project is related to brain MRI image classification using deep learning techniques and transformers

We have taken a publicly available brain MRI dataset from Kaggle and used pretrained models like RESNET50 and VITB16 to do the classification. We have generated classification reports and performance metrics for both models on the dataset and compared them.

## Model Performance

Below are the performance metrics and visualizations for the models:

### Accuracy and Loss
